# Met Office Informatics Lab
The Met Office Informatics Lab is affiliated with the UK's meteorological institution, the [Met Office](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk). We are working on open, collaborative, innovative ways of taking our vast amounts of data, and turning it into information that people want...whatever that means. If you want to work with us, or have any ideas about things we could do, then just shout!

This repo contains information about the Lab - resources, checklists etc. Please checkout out our [wiki](https://github.com/met-office-lab/Lab-Info/wiki)
